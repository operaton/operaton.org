## Operaton 1.0: A New Era for Open-Source Process Automation

Today marks a momentous milestone in our journey: **Operaton 1.0 is here!**

After months of dedicated work, rigorous testing, and invaluable community support, we're proud to announce the first stable, production-ready release of Operaton. This isn't just a version number—it's a commitment to the open-source community and the future of process automation.

### The Journey to 1.0

When we started Operaton as a fork of Camunda 7, our mission was clear: keep open-source process automation alive, accessible, and community-driven. But we didn't want to just maintain what existed—we wanted to build something **better, stronger, and truly open**.

The path to 1.0 has been marked by:

- **Over 1,500 commits** pushing the project forward
- **1,100+ pull requests merged** from dedicated contributors
- **370+ issues resolved** to ensure stability and reliability
- **60+ contributors** who believed in this vision
- **25,000+ automated tests** modernized to JUnit 5
- **80%+ code coverage** meeting SonarQube standards

These numbers tell a story of dedication, collaboration, and a shared belief that open-source process automation deserves a bright future.

### Battle-Tested and Production-Ready

Operaton 1.0 isn't just stable on paper—it's **proven in real-world environments**. Multiple organizations have already deployed Operaton in production, validating its reliability and robustness. Their confidence in our platform fuels our commitment to excellence.

This release represents more than technical achievements. It's about creating a platform that developers and businesses can trust for their most critical workflow automation needs.

### Seamless Migration Path

We understand that migrating platforms is a significant decision. That's why Operaton 1.0 maintains **full compatibility with Camunda 7.24**, making your transition as smooth as possible.

Here's how simple it can be:

1. Upgrade your Camunda installation to version 7.24 (if needed)
2. Switch your dependencies to Operaton
3. Use our OpenRewrite-based migration tools for automated updates

We've built the bridge—now you can cross it with confidence.

### What Makes 1.0 Special?

This release represents our promise to the community:

- **No breaking changes in the Java API** moving forward—stability you can depend on
- **Complete technical transparency**—no closed-source components, ever
- **Modern foundation**—built on current, supported technologies
- **Community-first approach**—your voice shapes our direction
- **Focus on the core**—BPM, CMMN, and DMN engines and closely related components

### A Community Achievement

Operaton 1.0 is not the work of a single team—it's a **community achievement**. Every bug report, every pull request, every discussion in our forum has contributed to making this release possible.

To everyone who tested beta versions, provided feedback, contributed code, or simply believed in what we're building: **Thank you.** This milestone belongs to all of us.

### Looking Forward

Reaching 1.0 isn't the end of our journey—it's the beginning of a new chapter. With a stable foundation in place, we're ready to innovate, grow, and continue building the BPM engine that **truly belongs to everyone**.
