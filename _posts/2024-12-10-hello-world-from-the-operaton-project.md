Welcome to **Operaton**, a community-driven project dedicated to keeping open-source process automation alive and thriving!

Operaton was born as a fork of **Camunda 7**, the widely respected open-source process engine that has been a cornerstone of Java-based process automation for years. After Camunda's announcement that the **Community Edition will reach its end of life in October 2025**, we knew it was time to act.

## Why Operaton?

Camunda 7 Community Edition has built an incredible legacy in the world of open-source process automation. It’s known for its seamless integration into Spring Boot and other Java applications, as well as its versatility as a lightweight external engine.

While we thank Camunda for their immense contribution and inspiration, the decision to discontinue the Community Edition left a gap in the open-source landscape. That’s why we’ve stepped in with **Operaton**—a project built on the foundation of Camunda 7, but with a renewed focus on community-driven innovation and complete technical transparency.

## Exciting Milestones So Far

We’re thrilled to share the progress we’ve made with Operaton so far:

- **Released Version Beta-2**
- **Processed 219 pull requests**
- **Resolved 63 issues**
- **Running 25,000 test cases daily** to ensure stability and reliability

Thanks to our incredible community of contributors, Operaton is growing rapidly. Together, we’re ensuring process automation remains accessible, open, and driven by the people who rely on it.

## Our Vision

Operaton is more than just a fork—it’s a fresh start.

- **No closed-source components.** Operaton will provide full technical transparency.
- **Community-first approach.** We’re building this together, with open collaboration at the heart of the project.
- **A modern roadmap.** We’re not just maintaining the past; we’re innovating for the future.
