## Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays from the Operaton Project!

As we close out another year, we have something special to celebrate with all of you: **Operaton has reached 100 stars on GitHub!**

This milestone is a testament to the incredible support and enthusiasm from our amazing community of developers, contributors, and supporters. Together, we share a vision of making BPMN accessible to everyone with a free, open-source engine that empowers innovation. Your trust and belief in our mission have been the greatest gift of 2024! 

On behalf of the Operaton team, we wish you and your loved ones a magical Christmas and a joyful holiday season filled with happiness, peace, and inspiration.

As we look ahead to 2025, we’re more excited than ever about the future of Operaton. There’s so much more to build, improve, and share with the world—and we can’t wait to do it together!
