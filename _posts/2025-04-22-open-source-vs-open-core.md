### How Operaton Does Governance Differently

Much of the digital world we rely on every day is built on open-source foundations. From smartphones (Android, based on Linux), to websites (WordPress, Apache, Nginx), and cloud-native infrastructure (Kubernetes, Docker)—modern technology would be unthinkable without open-source contributions.

While the software may be free to use, it is far from free to create.

#### Open Source: Built on Collaboration

Behind every impactful open-source project lies a network of dedicated developers, active community members, and companies investing time, expertise, and resources. Many of these efforts are supported by organizations whose staff contribute not for direct profit, but for broader strategic, technical, and societal benefits.

Open source is not "free as in free beer." It's "free as in freedom"—freedom to use, modify, distribute, and improve. It is about knowledge sharing, collaborative development, transparency, and a commitment to building better software together. Key pillars of open-source governance include:

- Inclusive decision-making
- Transparent security and code quality processes
- Open tracking of project activity and financials

These principles foster trust and encourage organic community growth driven by shared values and passion—not just commercial incentives.

#### The Limitations of the Open-Core Model

In contrast, the Open-Core model typically centers around a single company retaining control. While the core software is technically open source, critical features, updates, and integrations are often locked behind paid “enterprise” versions.

This approach has several downsides:

- **Restricted innovation**: Features vital to many users are not community-accessible.
- **Limited community engagement**: Independent contributors often focus on bug fixes rather than feature development.
- **Single-vendor dependence**: The roadmap is driven by one entity, reducing transparency and diversity of input.

While this model may drive short-term commercial gains, it often fails to cultivate the vibrant, sustainable ecosystems that pure open-source projects can achieve.

#### Operaton: 100% Open Source, Forever

Operaton takes a different approach. We are—and always will be—a fully open-source project. There is no “enterprise edition” with gated features. Everything we build is accessible to everyone, under the same open license.

Our model supports commercial collaboration through trusted partners who offer:

1. **Turn-Key Solutions** – Integrated offerings for specific industries and use-cases with Operaton at the core.
2. **Commercial Consulting & Enterprise Support** – Expert services, training, and technical support tailored to professional and enterprise environments.
3. **Combined Services** – Many partners blend both delivery and advisory, ensuring end-to-end value.

To safeguard our commitment to openness, the **Operaton trademark will be held by an independent non-profit organization**. This ensures no single company can monopolize the Operaton brand. Commercial vendors must build their own distributions and services on top of Operaton—just as Red Hat Enterprise Linux is based on the Linux kernel.

#### Join the Movement

Whether you’re interested in building solutions on top of Operaton, becoming a trusted partner, or simply contributing to the ecosystem—there’s a place for you in the Operaton community.

**Let’s build the future of process automation—together, openly, and sustainably.**
