## Versatile. Scalable. Future-Proof.

If you've ever worked with BPMN engines, you're familiar with the classic deployment dilemma: Should you embed it directly within your Java application, deploy it as a standalone service, host it on-premises, or embrace the scalability of the cloud?

Operaton simplifies this choice by supporting all these deployment scenarios seamlessly.

### Flexibility at its Core
With Operaton, you gain unparalleled flexibility:

- **Embedded Mode:** Integrate Operaton directly into your Java application for maximum control and performance.

- **Standalone Service:** Run Operaton as a dedicated service on your own infrastructure, providing isolation and manageability.

- **Cloud & Kubernetes:** Deploy seamlessly on cloud infrastructure or leverage Kubernetes orchestration for effortless scalability and management.

### Exciting News: Operaton Now Has a Helm Chart!

We’re thrilled to announce the release of the official **Helm chart** for Operaton!

Deploying Operaton on Kubernetes is now simpler than ever. With just a single command, you can have Operaton up and running, fully integrated into your Kubernetes environment.

You can find our Helm chart available on **ArtifactHUB**, the centralized repository for Kubernetes charts, which streamlines your workflow automation journey.

If you're running a local Kubernetes setup like Minikube, you're in luck! You can test-drive Operaton immediately without any complicated configuration steps.

Check out the details and start your Kubernetes deployment journey by visiting our [operaton-helm repository](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/operaton/operaton).
