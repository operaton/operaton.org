      <strong class="hero-name">Operaton</strong> is a community-driven, free, and open-source BPMN engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It inherited its source code from the legacy of Camunda, Activiti and their predecessors.
      Camunda 7 was an important contribution to the open-source BPMN community.
      Building on this legacy, we aim to create a thriving future for a truly free and open-source BPMN engine.
    </p>

      <summary>
        <h3>FAQ</h3>
      </summary>

      <h4>General</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>What is Operaton?</dt>
        <dd>Operaton is a community-driven, free, and open-source BPMN engine.</dd>

        <dt>What is BPMN?</dt>
        <dd>BPMN stands for Business Process Model and Notation. It is a graphical representation for specifying business processes in a business process model.</dd>

        <dt>What is the license of Operaton?</dt>
        <dd>Operaton is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.</dd>

        <dt>Why was Operaton created?</dt>
        <dd>
          Operaton was created as a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform">Camunda 7 CE</a> to provide an open, community-driven
          alternative after the end of life of Camunda 7 CE in October 2025.
        </dd>

        <dt>Who maintains Operaton?</dt>
        <dd>Operaton is maintained by an open-source community. Unlike proprietary BPMN solutions, no single company controls its direction.</dd>

        <dt>How is Operaton different from Camunda 7?</dt>
        <dd>
          Operaton started as a fork of Camunda 7, but it is evolving as an independent project.
          Initially, the focus is on providing a seamless transition for Camunda 7 users, ensuring full compatibility while modernizing certain aspects of the codebase.
        </dd>

        <dt>How is Operaton different from other Camunda 7 Forks?</dt>
        <dd>
          Operaton is not the only fork of Camunda 7. However, it is unique in its commitment to <b>community ownership</b> and <b>modernization of the code base</b>.
          While Operaton is a Free Open Source Software (FOSS) project, other forks may primarily be driven by commercial interests.
          While they might have also have their code available under an open-source license, they follow an Open Core model. There is no guarantee that the community can
          influence the direction of these projects.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h4>Technical Approach</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>What is the long-term technical strategy for Operaton?</dt>
        <dd>
          The primary goal for now is a <b>seamless transition from Camunda 7 to Operaton</b>. This means that <b>version 1.x</b> will prioritize stability and compatibility.
          Breaking changes, if necessary, will only come in <b>version 2.x or later</b>.
        </dd>

        <dt>Will there be major architectural changes?</dt>
        <dd>
          No, major rewrites or architectural overhauls are <i>not planned for the 1.x versions</i>.
          However, basic web applications will be rewritten, legacy containers will be dropped, and the codebase will be modernized—without breaking compatibility.
        </dd>

        <dt>When will Operaton introduce new innovations?</dt>
        <dd>Once a <b>stable and reliable foundation is established</b>, the community will collaboratively plan future innovations and enhancements for later versions.</dd>

        <dt>Does Operaton support microservices architectures?</dt>
        <dd>Yes, Operaton can be used in microservices environments. It provides REST APIs and supports lightweight execution models.</dd>

        <dt>Which Java version is required?</dt>
        <dd>Operaton requires a JVM >= 17 for execution.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h4>Governance & Community</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>How is the Operaton project governed?</dt>
        <dd>Operaton is a <b>true community-driven</b> initiative, meaning that <b>active contributors shape the direction</b> of the project.
          Governance is still forming, and contributors have the opportunity to define its structure.
        </dd>

        <dt>Will a formal organization govern Operaton?</dt>
        <dd>
          There are plans to establish a <b>non-profit organization</b> to manage key decisions.
          However, governance will remain open—no single company will be able to dictate
          the project’s direction against the interests of the community.
        </dd>

        <dt>How can my company influence the project?</dt>
        <dd>By actively contributing! The more you and your team engage with the project—through code contributions, governance discussions, or infrastructure support—the more you help shape its future.</dd>

        <dt>How does one become a committer?</dt>
        <dd>
          Gaining committer status requires <b>meaningful contributions over time</b>.
          Once a contributor has earned the trust of the community, they can be promoted to a committer.
          At the moment, the process is quite open — <b>just start contributing!</b>
        </dd>

        <dt>Is Operaton truly open?</dt>
        <dd>Yes! All discussions and decisions are public. If you have questions, we encourage you to ask them in the <a href="https://forum.operaton.org/">Forum</a> rather than in private.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h4>Release Planning</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>What is the release cycle for Operaton?</dt>
        <dd>
          While nothing is finalized yet, there is a high likelihood that releases will follow a fixed cadence,
          possibly half-yearly or quarterly, depending on community needs and available resources.
          The project team will provide more details as the project matures.
        </dd>

        <dt>Will there be an LTS (Long-Term Support) version?</dt>
        <dd>
          Yes, version 1.x will be considered LTS.
          However, Operaton itself does not provide SLAs (Service Level Agreements). Companies that offer Operaton support services will need to ensure long-term maintenance.
        </dd>

        <dt>What happens after version 1.x?</dt>
        <dd>
          After establishing a stable 1.x version, the project will <b>gradually modernize and evolve</b>.
          The goal is to <b>stay relevant for the next decade</b> while maintaining backward compatibility.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h4>Security</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>How secure is Operaton?</dt>
        <dd>Operaton follows security best practices, including authentication, authorization, and encrypted database connections.</dd>

        <dt>Can I use Operaton with Single Sign-On (SSO)?</dt>
        <dd>Yes, Operaton supports authentication via OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and LDAP.</dd>

        <dt>What security policies are in place for Operaton?</dt>
        <dd>Operaton follows a security policy that includes vulnerability management, responsible disclosure, and best practices for open-source security.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h4>Migration from Camunda 7 CE</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>Can I migrate from Camunda 7 Community Edition (CE) to Operaton?</dt>
        <dd>Yes! Operaton is designed to be a <b>drop-in replacement</b> for Camunda 7 CE, ensuring a smooth transition.</dd>

        <dt>Will my existing BPMN processes work in Operaton?</dt>
        <dd>
          Yes. The 1.x versions of Operaton prioritize <b>full compatibility with Camunda 7</b>.
          Your BPMN models, process definitions, and execution logic will continue to work without changes.
        </dd>

        <dt>How do I migrate from Camunda 7 to Operaton?</dt>
        <dd>
          The migration process is straightforward:
          <ol>
            <li>Upgrade to Camunda 7 CE <b>version 7.24</b>, which is the latest release before its end of life.</li>
            <li>Update your application dependencies to use Operaton instead of Camunda 7.</li>
            <li>Replace the Camunda 7 libraries with Operaton equivalents in your build system (Maven, Gradle, etc.).</li>
            <li>Verify compatibility with your existing database schema.</li>
            <li>Run tests to ensure process execution behaves as expected.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            A detailed <b>migration guide</b> will be available soon.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>What about database compatibility?</dt>
        <dd>Operaton <b>keeps the same database schema as Camunda 7</b>, so no database migration is required when switching.</dd>

        <dt>Are there tools to assist with migration?</dt>
        <dd>Yes, the community is working on migration tooling to automate dependency updates and compatibility checks.</dd>

        <dt>Will Camunda Modeler still work with Operaton?</dt>
        <dd>Yes, you can continue using Camunda Modeler to design BPMN diagrams and deploy them to Operaton.</dd>

        <dt>Does Operaton support Camunda 7 plugins?</dt>
        <dd>Operaton does support the same plugin mechanism as Camunda 7. However, since namespaces have changed, the plugins will require small rewrites to use the Operaton
          API.</dd>

        <dt>Is there commercial support available for migration?</dt>
        <dd>Since Operaton is a free and open-source project, commercial support is provided by third-party companies offering consulting and migration services.</dd>
