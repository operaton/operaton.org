# About Operaton

Operaton is a community-driven free open-source BPMN engine.

It inherited its source code from the legacy of Camunda, Activiti and their predecessors. 
Camunda 7 was an important contribution to the open-source BPMN community. 
Building on this legacy, we aim to create a thriving future for a truly free and open-source BPMN engine.

We are in the process of forming a legal foundation, specifically a German eingetragener Verein (Registered Association), that will own the project and its trademark.
